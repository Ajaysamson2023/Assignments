  **Question 3**

  - Created a new branch and named it as feature branch.
  - Added code to the feature branch and checked whether the code is reflected in main branch or not.
  - Pushed the feature branch to the git repository.
  - After Pushed code feature branch with main branch is merged.
  - Since,We are using personal repository,it is merged.
  - If we face any conflicts,from my point of view  git rebase 
  - It means that two of your commits modified the same line in the same file, and Git doesn't know which change to apply on  that time will use git rebase.
